 # Using Capsule for soft multi tenancy 

 The general idea behind capsule is that i can create a tenant assign a group of teams / users to each tenants and i have total control over actions that can take on the cluster it self 

 This tenants can also create their own namespaces totally isolated to them thanks to capsule i can enforce isolation and security hardening at tenant level to some extent so any resources created by tenants would automatically inherit this rules
